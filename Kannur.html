  <p>Kannur is northernmost districts of Kerala blessed with full of greenary and historious places. Kannur is famous for Politics and Temple festivals. It was once an ancient trading port. Enduring monuments such as 16th-century St. Angelo Fort, once occupied by European colonial forces, show the city’s significant role in the spice trade. Housed in a former palace, the Arakkal Museum highlights Kerala's one Muslim royal family. The palm-fringed sands of Payyambalam Beach run along Kannur’s western shore.Towards the north of Kozhikod and Wayanad districts lies the district of Kannur. The region is famous for the dazzling ritual performance called Theyyam.Kannur is rightly described as “The land of Looms and Lores”. Kannur is well known for its handlooms. It is one of the major exporter handlooms in India. The handloom cloths of Kannur have won international reputation. The industry was confined to the production of coarse varieties of dhoties and like, in the past. Production of quality and exportable varieties of handloom fabric was started when the Basal Evengelical Mission entered the field. The handloom industry, which was once the monopoly of private enterprise, has since been organised on co-operative lines. It provides employment to hundreds of thousands of people directly and indirectly.

    Kannur is rich in traditional art and culture. Kannur is the home of Kerala folklore academy.
