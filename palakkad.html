  <p>Palakkad, or Palghat, is a city in Kerala, a state in southwestern India. The 18th-century Palakkad Fort has sturdy battlements, a moat and a Hanuman temple on its grounds. North, on the Kalpathy River, the 15th-century Viswanatha Swamy Temple is the main venue of the famous Ratholsavam chariot festival. Northeast, near Malampuzha Dam, the town of Malampuzha has a rock garden created from recycled materials.What makes Palakkad distinct from other parts of Kerala is its predominantly rural nature coupled with enormous expanses of paddy fields. Endless stretch of palm trees, green carpeted landscapes, dense tropical forests and undulating hilly terrains make Palakkad a visual treat to spectators. By contributing massively to the rice production of Kerala, Palakkad has rightfully grabbed two titles - ‘The Rice Bowl of Kerala’ and ‘The Granary of Kerala’.

      <p class="card-text"> Tipu's Fort, also known as Palakkad Fort, is a beautifully maintained edifice in Palakkad district and was an important military base in the past.

Named after Hyder's son Tipu Sultan, it is an important historical destination today.

        It is among the best preserved forts in South India. The thick laterite walls impress all who view it. People frequent the spot for relaxing walks and jogs.
