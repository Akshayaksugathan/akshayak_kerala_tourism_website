The fort appears to emerge from the sea. Almost three-quarters of its exterior is in contact with water. Bekal fort was not an administrative centre and does not include any palaces or mansions.

        An important feature is the water-tank, magazine and the flight of steps leading to an observation tower built by Tipu Sultan.

This is the only lake temple in Kerala and is believed to be the original seat (Moolasthanam) of Ananthapadmanabha Swami (Padmanabhaswamy temple) Thiruvananthapuram. Legend has it that this is the original site where Ananthapadmanabha settled down.

        The lake in which the Sanctum Sanctorum is built measures about 2 acres (302 feet square).

      <p class="card-text"> Ranipuram is a renowned tourist destination in the northern tip of Kerala. Located in Kasaragod, it is situated 750 m above sea level. It makes for a perfect picnic spot where one can even come across the occasional herd of elephants. Once known as Madathumala, it borders Karnataka and boasts of some of the best trekking trails in the area. Regular buses are available on this route and jeep rides are another favourite among all our visitors. The versatile vegetation that includes evergreen shola woods, monsoon forests and grasslands make it a good place to relax and take some time off from the rigors of daily life.
